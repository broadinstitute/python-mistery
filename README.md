## Releases

Releases to the codebase are typically done using the [bump2version][2] tool.  This tool takes care of updating the version in all necessary files, updating its own configuration, and making a GitHub commit and tag.  We typically do version bumps as part of a PR, so you don't want to have [bump2version][2] tag the version at the same time it does the commit as commit hashes may change.  Therefore, to bump the version a patch level, one would run the command:

```sh
bump2version --verbose --no-tag patch
```

Once the PR is merged, you can then checkout the new master branch and tag it using the new version number that is now in `.bumpversion.cfg`:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull --rebase
git tag 1.0.0 -m 'Bump version: 0.1.0 â†’ 1.0.0'
git push --tags
```
